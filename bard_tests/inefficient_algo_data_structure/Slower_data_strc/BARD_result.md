## Prompt
In this code you don't need to know the context of the code to find the performance bug just focus on the problem in the snippet:

          : m_localization_id(0)
    # endif
      {
        visited_facets[0] =

          visited_facets[2] = 
          visited_facets[3] = false;
      }

## Response

The performance bug in the code you provided is that the visited_facets array is not thread-safe. This means that multiple threads could be accessing the array at the same time, which could lead to data races.

To fix this bug, you can replace the visited_facets array with a thread-safe data structure, such as a std::atomic<char> array. You can also use the compare-and-swap (CAS) instruction to update the array atomically.

Here is an example of how to fix the bug:

Code snippet

    #include <tbb/atomic.h>

    class Compact_mesh_cell_base_3_base<Parallel_tag>
    {
    public:
      // ...

    private:
      /// Stores visited facets
      std::atomic<char> visited_facets[4];
    };

After making this change, the visited_facets array will be thread-safe, which will prevent data races. This will improve the performance of the code.

Here are some additional tips for improving the performance of parallel code:

Use thread-safe data structures.
Use the compare-and-swap (CAS) instruction to update data structures atomically.
Avoid using locks and mutexes, as they can introduce contention and reduce performance.
Use a parallel programming library, such as OpenMP or TBB, to help you manage threads and synchronization.
