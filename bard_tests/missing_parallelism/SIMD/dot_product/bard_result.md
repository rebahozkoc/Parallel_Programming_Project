### Prompt
I want you to classify the performance bug in this code :

    //compile with: g++ prefetch.cpp  -std=c++11 -O3 
    //use -fopt-info-vec-optimized for vectorization info verbose
    //run: ./a.out

    #include <emmintrin.h>
    #include <smmintrin.h>
    #include <immintrin.h>
    #include <iostream>
    #include <chrono>
    using namespace std;

    #define N 1024 * 1024 * 1024

    void dot_norm(int* a, int* b, int& sum) {
    sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++){
        sum += a[i]*b[i];
    }
    }
    int main() {
    cout << "An int is " << sizeof(int) << " bytes "<< endl;

    int* a = (int*)_mm_malloc(N * sizeof(int), 16); 
    int* b = (int*)_mm_malloc(N * sizeof(int), 16);
    
    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        a[i] = i % 0x000000FF;
        b[i] = i % 0x000000FF;
    }
    int sum = 0;
    auto t1 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    dot_norm(a, b, sum);
    auto t2 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    cout << sum << " dot_norm " << chrono::duration_cast<chrono::milliseconds>(t2-t1).count() << " milliseconds\n";
    return 0;
    }
### Response
The performance bug in the code snippet you provided is the lack of vectorization. Vectorization is a technique that can be used to improve the performance of code by performing operations on multiple data points at the same time.

In the code snippet, the dot_norm() function iterates over the a and b arrays. The a and b arrays are large, so it is likely that the CPU will have to fetch data from memory multiple times. This can lead to performance bottlenecks.

To improve the performance of the code, you can use vectorization to perform operations on multiple data points at the same time. This can be done using the __builtin_vec_add() intrinsic function.

Here is the modified code snippet:

C++
#include <emmintrin.h>
#include <smmintrin.h>
#include <immintrin.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <chrono>
using namespace std;

#define N 1024 * 1024 * 1024

void dot_norm(int* a, int* b, int& sum) {
    __m128i sum_vec = _mm_setzero_si128();
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i+=16){
        __m128i a_vec = _mm_loadu_si128((__m128i *) (a + i));
        __m128i b_vec = _mm_loadu_si128((__m128i *) (b + i));
        sum_vec = _mm_add_epi32(sum_vec, _mm_mul_epi32(a_vec, b_vec));
    }
    sum = _mm_cvtsi128_si32(sum_vec);
}

int main() {
    cout << "An int is " << sizeof(int) << " bytes "<< endl;

    int* a = (int*)_mm_malloc(N * sizeof(int), 16); 
    int* b = (int*)_mm_malloc(N * sizeof(int), 16);
    
    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        a[i] = i % 0x000000FF;
        b[i] = i % 0x000000FF;
    }
    int sum = 0;
    auto t1 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    dot_norm(a, b, sum);
    auto t2 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    cout << sum << " dot_norm " << chrono::duration_cast<chrono::milliseconds>(t2-t1).count() << " milliseconds\n";
    return 0;
}

After making this change, the dot_norm() function will perform operations on 16 data points at the same time. This can improve the performance of the code by reducing the number of times the CPU has to fetch data from memory.

The category of this bug is a performance bug. Performance bugs are bugs that cause a program to run slower than it could. Performance bugs can be caused by a variety of factors, including poor algorithm design, inefficient code, and lack of optimization.

In this case, the performance bug is caused by the lack of vectorization. Vectorization can improve the performance of code by performing operations on multiple data points at the same time. This can reduce the number of times the CPU has to fetch data from memory, which can improve the performance of the code.
