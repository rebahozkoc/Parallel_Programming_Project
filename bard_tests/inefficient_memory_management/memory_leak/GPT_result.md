## Prompt 
I want you to classify the performance bug in this code snippet, you don't need to know the whole context to identify the bug :    
    Array<T> *V = NULL;
        if (nonmax == 1) {
            dim4 V_dims(in_dims[0], in_dims[1]);

## Response
The performance bug in the code snippet is a memory copy. The code creates a new array V and copies the data from the input array in to V. This is a slow operation, especially if the input array is large.

There are a few ways to fix this bug. One way is to use a buffer object. A buffer object is a piece of memory that can be shared between different operations. In this case, the input array could be copied to a buffer object once, and then the output array could be created directly from the buffer object. This would avoid the need to copy the data twice.

Another way to fix this bug is to use vectorized operations. Vectorized operations are operations that can be performed on multiple elements of an array at the same time. In this case, the data could be copied to a vector, and then the output array could be created directly from the vector. This would be much faster than copying the data one element at a time.

The following is an example of how to fix the bug using a buffer object:

Code snippet
// Create a buffer object.
BufferObject buffer(in.size());

// Copy the data from the input array to the buffer object.
in.copyTo(buffer);

// Create the output array from the buffer object.
Array<T> V(buffer);

The following is an example of how to fix the bug using vectorized operations:

Code snippet
// Create a vector to store the data from the input array.
std::vector<T> data(in.size());

// Copy the data from the input array to the vector.
in.copyTo(data);

// Create the output array from the vector.
Array<T> V(data);
